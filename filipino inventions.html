             <h3>Yo-Yo</h3>
             <p> The original "yoyo" was big, had pointed edges, and was studded. The weapon was fastened to strong, heavy 20-foot ropes that could be thrown at adversaries or animals.

             <h3>E-Jeepney</h3>
             <p>The Philippines' main means of transportation is the e-Jeepney, which can be found practically everywhere on streets and roads there.

             <h3>Fish Sauce/Patis</h3>
             <p>Many Filipino cuisines include patis, also known as fish sauce, as a salty dipping sauce. Its unexpected discovery in 1949 was made by Ruperta David (also known as Aling Tentay). After the war, her family launched a company selling dried fish, and that was when everything began. Then, one day, Aling Tentay kept jars of salted fish. The fish that had been kept in storage started to change into the patis.</p>

             <h3>Banana Catsup</h3>
             <p> Maria Orosa y Ylagan, a food technologist, was the one who came up with this. Although the precise history of banana ketchup is unknown, it is widely believed to have started during World War II when American troops introduced tomato ketchup to the Philippines. Locals in the Philippines changed it to a banana version because tomatoes were difficult to get.</p>

             <h3>16-Bit Microchip</h3>
             <p>A self-contained system called a 16 bit microchip, which has memory, a CPU, and peripherals, may be readily integrated into any system to make it function properly. The first calculator with a single chip and a 16-bit microprocessor was made by Dado Banatao, also known as Diosdado Banatao. He is also credited with developing the first system logic chip set for IBM's PC-XT and PC-AT, as well as the local bus concept.</p>
