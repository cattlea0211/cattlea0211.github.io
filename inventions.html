        <div class="inventions-right">
            <p>The new Metaverse is an online shared space wherein both physical and virtual reality are mixed together.It provides change to our everyday activities such as work, shopping, and communication. It also opened remarkable opportunities for every company regarding their presence on social media to their office work, payments, healthcare, the purchase and sale of products, and more.</p>

        <div class="inventions-right">
            <p>The digital twin is a technique that allows us to create a virtual replica of a real-world object and assess its advantages and disadvantages before putting the finished product in the hands of the customer. It is a modern method of market research that simulates products using computer-aided design (CAD). A digital twin, on the other hand, is more sophisticated and designed for real-time simulations.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="inventions-right">
            <p>Who would have imagined that, by 2022, mobile phones and computers would easily feature foldable screens? A smartphone with a foldable form factor is a foldable phone. A flexible display is used in certain concepts that use several touchscreen panels mounted on a hinge. Well, ASUS and Samsung have both entered the slightly less saturated market with their own foldable laptops, the Zenbook 17 fold and the ubiquitous Galaxy flip and fold phones.Depending on the situation, the Zenbook's 17.3-inch screen can be used as a tablet, book, laptop, or even a computer.</p>

            <h2>SOLAR ROOF SHINGLES</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="inventions-right">
            <p>There is no denying that solar energy is the way of the future, but many of us have been put off by the idea of installing enormous, unwieldy panels on our terraces. Fortunately, GAF Energy, a solar roofing business, has developed the Timberline Solar solar shingle, which installs like a regular roof. This innovative roofing material is sturdy, attractive, and simple to install with a nail gun just like any other shingle. Solar panel installation requires a roof, but GAF Energy's Timberline Solar technology offers both in a single, excellent solution.</p>

        <div class="inventions-right">
            <p>Endovascular procedures are difficult to perform without specialized training, which takes years to master. As a result, they are typically found at large medical centers in urban regions and only a small percentage of doctors are able to complete them (per MIT). There is a "golden hour" when a patient is having a stroke or aneurysm, when they can be treated without suffering long-term effects. That's all well and good if you happen to live close to a major hospital, but for people who live in remote places without access to surgeons with specialized training, it might be the difference between a successful recovery and failure.</p>

        <div class="inventions-right">
            <p>It is a microchip with artificial intelligence that can read and record brain activity. Additionally, it may generate visuals and audio, as well as deliver impulses straight to the brain. With the goal of healing blindness and other brain-related illnesses, it is designed to link to the internet and any electronics. The device by Neuralink features a chip that analyses and sends neurological signals that may be sent to gadgets like a phone or a computer. The business envisions a day when someone might possibly operate a mouse, keyboard, or other computer input devices using only their thoughts.</p>
