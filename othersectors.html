        <h2>VAL: Video Assisted Learning</h2>    
            <p>A student's comprehension, cognitive ability, or social-emotional abilities can all be improved by the use of instructional or conceptual movies, which is known as "video-assisted learning" (VAL). In distance learning settings, where students study from computer displays, this tendency is also rising. Ones, especially animated videos, are a great way to enhance courses and improve comprehension of the material. It raises student achievement while lightening the load on teachers.</p>

        <h2>Blockchain Technology</h2>    
            <p>A sophisticated database system called blockchain technology enables transparent information sharing inside a company network. Data is kept in blocks that are connected together in a chain and stored in a blockchain database. An asset may be physical (such as a home, car, money, or land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and ePortfolios leverage blockchain technology to validate students' skills and knowledge. For eLearning agencies, the DLT systems will provide solutions to the issues of authentication, scale, and affordability. Additionally, it can assist student applicants in publishing their successes when they are looking for work.

        <h2>RPA in Banking</h2>    
            <p>The most popular technology for automation, known as robotic process automation, or RPA, simply automates fixed and repeated procedures. Automation, as opposed to AI, uses a straightforward set of principles (If this Equals then that) to provide relatively straightforward but trustworthy outputs. These pre-programmed rules can apply to unstructured data (forms filled out by hand) or structured data (incoming data on interest charts) to handle digitization, approval, risk flagging, and other processes. Many also incorporate learning patterns, which allows them to get better over time based on growing data volumes.</p>
